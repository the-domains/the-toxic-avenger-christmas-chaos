The Toxic Avenger Christmas Chaos 

The Toxic Avenger - Christmas Chaos is a new spin-off musical based on the New York Outer Critic's circle winner for 2009 Best Off-Broadway Musical.

What kind of homicidal lunatic is gunning down all the reindeer? What are Betty Belgoody and her evil brood of elves plotting for the holiday season? Will Governor Toxie Ferd be forced to cancel Christmas altogether?

With Music by Tom Polum, Lyrics by Omri Schein and a book by Polum and Schein, this new musical comedy is something different for the Holidays.  With orchestrations by Douglas Katsaros for piano, bass, guitar and drums you can rock the holidays with this hilarious new show.
